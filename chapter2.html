			<h4 class="ta__left" >2.1 What is Data Science and Big Data?</h4>
			In the last few years the amount of available data has increased tremendously. Whether we talk about the economy, where companies track the customer behavior for marketing purposes, your everyday life, where you use social networks, or science, where instruments are measuring the space weather - data can be found everywhere. According to the “10 Key Marketing Trends for 2017” report from IBM, we produce 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day and 90% of the data in the world has been created in the last two years alone. But what can we gain from all these data? It is not a problem to find data today, the problem is to figure out what to do with the data [1].
			Data Science is about acquiring knowledge from data. The word “science” implies, that the knowledge is gained through systematic studies - making hypotheses and investigating them [2]. One way to investigate the data is visualizing it and trying to find patterns in it. Even if Data Science goes far beyond that - by analyzing data through advanced algorithms, including machine learning or neuronal networks: most of the time it comes back to a point where results of an algorithm have to be understood by a human. A common way to understand the output, which is mostly a set of numbers, is to draw a graph [1].
			When we take a closer look at the word “data” in Data Science, it reveals the real challenge.
			The amount of data is usually big, fast growing and it is getting increasingly inhomogeneous and unstructured [2]. The combined data from different sources and types like Wikipedia (text),  Youtube (videos), Facebook (images), etc. enables data scientist so reveal new knowledge. But processing this data is a challenging task.
			The buzzword Big Data got popular for the kind of data that has a big <strong>volume</strong> (regarding the amount of data), a large <strong>variety</strong> (referring to the number and type of sources) and a high <strong>velocity</strong> (describing the speed at which the data is processed) - known as the three V`s of Big Data [3].

			<h4 class="ta__left">2.2 Visualization of Big Data</h4>
			There are many efforts to visualize Big Data. The main reason of its visualization is to reveal anomalies or hidden patterns in the data, to obtain relative differences by comparing various units and to enable human interaction in real-time [4]. The state of art in terms of Big Data visualization is the creation of images as simple and abstract as possible to represent the essential criteria of the data successfully. Therefore, most modern visualization tools are considering fundamental human cognitive psychology. This implies for example the use of different colors to catch significant differences in data, the use of different sizes to identify the most important element or the use of similarity to identify groups [4].
			The visualization of Big Data in VR is a modern attempt to extend the efforts of classical visualization. The better spatial understanding, the bigger size of total visual field as well as the options for intuitive interaction can simplify the process of visualization and knowledge extraction - especially for a complex set of data.
			The adjacted video shows some work made my by Virtualistics, a company started by NASA JPL and the California Institute of Technology, focusing on the visualization of Big Data in VR.
