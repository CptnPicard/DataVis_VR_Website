	   <h4>4.1 What is Unity</h4>
	   Unity is a runtime development environment for game design that is developed by the company <italic>Unity Technologies</italic>. The development environment allows an interactive design of 3D applications. A 3D scene can be created with so called GameObjects, which are organized in a <a class="td_underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph">scene graph</a>. GameObjects like primitive bodies (sphere, cube, ...), light sources, cameras, etc. can be added to a scene within the editor. Components like scripts, materials or physical attributes can get attached to GameObjects. The simulated behavior of the GameObject can be observed through a game view. Finished projects can be exported as executable applications.

	<p>
	   <h4>4.2 Download and Installation </h4>
	   The newest version of Unity can be downloaded <a class="td_underline" href="https://store.unity.com/de/download?ref=personal">here</a>. This tutorial is using the Unity version <italic>2017.2</italic>. Follow the installation instructions given by the install application. Unity is free for non-commercial use but you have to create an Unity-Account at the end of the installation. Once the installation is done and you have created your account, you can start to set up a new Project in Unity.

	   <h4>4.3 Create a new Project </h4>
	    To create a new project, follow these steps:<br/>

		
		<div class="sbo">
		&#8594; Click <strong>New</strong> in the upper right<br/>
		&#8594; Select <strong>3D</strong> (since we want to create a three dimensional project)<br/>
		&#8594; Enter a <strong>project name</strong>, for example “Data_Visualization”<br/>
		&#8594; Select a <strong>location</strong> where you want to store your project<br/>
		&#8594; Press <strong>Create project</strong> to create your new project</div><br/>

	<h4>4.4 The development environment <italic>Unity Editor</italic></h4>
	Once the new project is created, the <italic>Unity Editor</italic> will open. The <italic>Unity Editor</italic> provides several windows, menus and blanks. Before we start, we should have a look at the most important features. <br />
	The window in the center is showing us the <strong>Asset Store</strong>. The Asset Store offers toolkits, plugins, predesigned objects and other content. Everything can be bought, downloaded and imported through the editor. 
	Next to the Asset Store there are two other tabs for the centered window. Selecting the <strong>Game</strong> tab will open the game window, which shows an ingame view.
	The third tab <strong>Scene</strong> will open an overview over the game scene. Unity will add a Main Camera and a Directional Light to any new scene by default. You should see them in the scene window. 
	On the left, next to the centered window, you can see the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>. The Hierarchy contains all <strong>GameObjects</strong> of a scene and is used to organize all GameObjects.
	To get further informations on a specific GameObject you can click on an object in the Hierarchy (for example the “Main Camera”), go to the rightmost window and open the tab <strong>Inspector</strong>. The Inspector contains all information about the selected GameObject.
	The bottom window is the <strong>project explorer</strong>. The new project contains only an empty Assets folder. This folder will store scenes, scripts and other components of the project later.
